# Build JMES Core

JMES Core is the official Golang reference implementation of the JMES node software. Use this guide to install JMES Core and jmesd, the command-line interface and daemon that connects to JMES and enables you to interact with the JMES blockchain.

## Get the JMES Core source code

1. Use `git` to retrieve [JMES Core](https://github.com/jmesworld/core/), and check out the `feat/winning_grants` branch, which contains the latest stable release. You can find the latest tag on the [tags page](https://github.com/jmesworld/core/tags) or via autocomplete in your terminal: type `git checkout v` and press `<TAB>`.

   ```
   git clone -b feat/winning_grants https://github.com/jmesworld/core
   ```

2. Use `git` to retrieve the jmesworld version of [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/jmesworld/cosmos-sdk/), and check out the `v0.0.99-alpha.3` tag, which contains the latest stable release. Also, find the path to this folder for use in step 4.

   ```py
   git clone https://github.com/jmesworld/cosmos-sdk.git
   ```
   ```py
   #  Switch to your cosmos-sdk folder
   cd cosmos-sdk 
   ```
   ```py
   # Checkout the latest tagged version to a local branch
   git checkout tags/v0.0.99-alpha.3 -b latest
   ```
   ```py
   # Note the path to the folder and return to the home directory 
   pwd   # e.g. /root/cosmos-sdk
   cd ..
   ```

3. Similarly, use `git` to retrieve the jmesworld version of [Tendermint](https://github.com/jmesworld/tendermint/), and check out the `v0.99.0-alpha.1` tag, which contains the latest stable release. Also, find the path to this folder for use in step 4.

   ```py
   git clone https://github.com/jmesworld/tendermint.git
   ```
   ```py
   #  Switch to your tendermint folder
   cd tendermint 
   ```
   ```py
   # Checkout the latest tagged version to a local branch
   git checkout tags/v0.99.0-alpha.3 -b latest
   ```
   ```py
   # Note the path to the folder and return to the home directory 
   pwd   # e.g. /root/tendermint
   cd ..
   ```

4. Replace cosmos-sdk and tendermint dependencies in the `replace` section of the `go.mod` file. Ensure you replace `<PATH TO YOUR local folder>` with those nnoted in Steps 2 & 3  above.

   ```py
   cd core

   sed -i 's|github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk => github.com/jmesworld/cosmos-sdk v0.46.0-jmes.1| github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk => <PATH TO YOUR cosmos-sdk folder>|g' go.mod

   #Example: sed -i 's|github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk => github.com/jmesworld/cosmos-sdk v0.46.0-jmes.1|github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk => /root/cosmos-sdk|g' go.mod

   ```
    ```py
   sed -i 's|github.com/tendermint/tendermint => github.com/jmesworld/tendermint v0.34.21-jmes.1| github.com/tendermint/tendermint => <PATH TO YOUR tendermint folder>|g' go.mod

   #sed -i 's|github.com/tendermint/tendermint => github.com/jmesworld/tendermint v0.34.21-jmes.1| github.com/tendermint/tendermint => /root/tendermint|g' go.mod

   ```

5. Build JMES Core. This will install the JMESd executable to your [ `GOPATH` ](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code) environment variable.

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

6. Verify that JMES Core is installed correctly.

   ```bash
   jmesd version --long
   ```

   **Example**:

   ```bash
   name: jmes
   server_name: jmesd
   version: feat/winning_grants-8d8a9c26047d9b834ada5c3c7c6880857b3ee4e1
   commit: 8d8a9c26047d9b834ada5c3c7c6880857b3ee4e1
   build_tags: netgo ledger,
   go: go version go1.20.4 linux/amd64
   # ...followed by a lot of dependenecies
   ```

If the `jmesd: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that the Go binary path is correctly configured by running the following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
