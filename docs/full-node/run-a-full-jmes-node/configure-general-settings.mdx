# Configure general settings

## Initialize and configure moniker

Initialize the node with a human-readable name:

```bash
jmesd init <your_custom_moniker> # ex., jmesd init michaelscott-node
```

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Moniker characters">

Monikers can only contain ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters will render your node unreachable by other peers in the network.

</Admonition>

You can update your node's moniker by editing the `moniker` field in `~/.jmes/config/config.toml`.

## [Optional] Update minimum gas prices

1. Open `~/.jmes/config/app.toml`.

2. Modify `minimum-gas-prices` and set the minimum price of gas a validator will accept to validate a transaction and to prevent spam.

The recommended setting post IDP (~ first month) to prevent spam transactions is:
`minimum-gas-prices = "0.1ujmes"`

**Example**:

```toml
# The minimum gas prices a validator is willing to accept for processing a
# transaction. A transaction's fees must meet the minimum of any denomination
# specified in this config (e.g. 0.25token1;0.0001token2).
minimum-gas-prices = "0.1ujmes"

```

## [Optional] Public RPC Configuration
If you would like your node's RPC to be publicly available and serve requests, follow the steps below. This is not compulsory.

1. Open `~/.jmes/config/config.toml`.

2. Locate the `RPC Server Configuration Options` section (`[rpc]`).

3. Change `laddr = "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"` to `laddr = "tcp://<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:26657"`.
```toml
    # TCP or UNIX socket address for the RPC server to listen on
    laddr = "tcp://<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:26657"   # Example: laddr = "tcp://164.92.191.45:26657"
```

4. Open `~/.jmes/config/client.toml`.

5. Change `node = "tcp://localhost:26657"` to `node = "tcp://<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:26657"`.

```toml
    # <host>:<port> to Tendermint RPC interface for this chain
    node = "tcp://<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:26657"   # Example: node = "tcp://164.92.191.45:26657"
```

## Set up `external_address` in `config.toml`

In order to be added to the address book in seed nodes, you need to configure `external_address` in `config.toml`. This addition will prevent continuous reconnections. The default P2P_PORT is `26656`.

1. Open `~/.jmes/config/config.toml`.

2. Locate the `P2P Configuration Options` section (`[p2p]`).

3. Change `external_address = ":26656"` to `external_address = "<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:26656"`.

```sh
# Address to advertise to peers for them to dial
# If empty, will use the same port as the laddr,
# and will introspect on the listener or use UPnP
# to figure out the address. ip and port are required
# example: 159.89.10.97:26656
external_address = "<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:26656" 
```
